<p>Why do we have to accept <strong><u>Trump</u> as president</strong>?
<br>Should we choose him?
</p>

<p>
There may be many reasons, but the most important reason is that <u>Trump is a Christian</u>.
<br>

<br>And Trump must keep what he said and he is a faithful person. 
<br>Have you ever seen a president who had the highest rate of commitment among all U.S. presidents? like TRUMP.

</p>

<p>
And he is a person with a very good heart. Throughout his entire life, 
<br>he has shown that he makes the right choice and always has a good influence on everyone. 
<br>It's just a waste of time to explain him any more. <strong>We must choose him no matter what.</strong>
<br>If you're considering whether you can vote for Trump as president, 
<br>I can assure you that you're wasting your time on the most useless worries of your life.
